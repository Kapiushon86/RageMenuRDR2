FOLDER STRUCTURE

Ui/ - Contains all ui elements drawing, writing sprites, menu version, etc basically everything you see. menu_version.h is where current version is defined, drawing.cpp handles most of the drawing but some other are done throughout ui and SubmenuIDs contains all the submenu ids which are needed when creating a new submenu.

Utils/Config - All config related files, so all folders and files created here loading ini config stuff some logging etc.

Utils/Saving/States - Inside here you will find a bunch of submenu folders this is where the default states of each file is located for bool and vector features, .cpp is where default states are stored .h is where they are defined.

Utils/Functions - There will be many folder submenus here inside will also be many files in most, there will be an cpp file and an h file the functions cpp files contain all the function logic for all the features the h defines all the functions, additionally inside each of these submenu folders is another folder called UpdateFeaturesLoop. These are where features are stored that will run every frame this is called in script.cpp and put in every submenu folder to make easier and more organized.
